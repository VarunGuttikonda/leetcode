# Welcome
Computer Programmers need to be fast with problem solving and should be able to solve the problems in the least amount of **Time Complexity** possible. For that practise of algorithms is a must. Every programmer should solve at least one algorithm problem everyday.  
This repository contains my solutions to problems on **LeetCode** and **Hackerrank**. All of the solutions are written in `JavaScript`.
